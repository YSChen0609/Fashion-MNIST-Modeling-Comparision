# Fashion-MNIST-Modeling-Comparision
This project is focused on comparing two distinct models, the Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), to determine their effectiveness in image classification using the FashionMNIST dataset.

By working through this project, we have a chance to work on Pytorch and ML/Data packages, also we can dive deeper into the theoretical foundations of CNNs and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (specifically LightGBM) and the problem-solving thoughts.
